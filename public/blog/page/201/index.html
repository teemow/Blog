  <div class="entry-content"><p>Frank Boosman posted a New York Times editorial on his blog &lt;a title=&quot;pseudorandom&quot; href=&quot;http://www.boosman.com/blog/2003_03_01_blogarchive.html#90561724&quot;&gt;pseudorandom&lt;/a&gt;. To quote the editorial: &lt;I&gt;It has been 14 months since the first prisoners from the Afghanistan war were taken to a naval base at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba. The Bush administration says it can hold the detainees indefinitely, without allowing them access to family or legal counsel. Yesterday, a federal Court of Appeals threw out a challenge by some of those detainees to their confinement. The administration and the court are wrong. The detainees may not have the same rights as American citizens, but they are entitled to more due process than they are being given.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>This is very important to think about and remember.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;p&gt;(Originally published on the <a href="http://blog.thylmann.net/category/oubs/">OUBS Blog</a>)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;This is an article by Henry Mintzberg and James A. Waters. In it, they argue that there is often an intended and a realized strategy. They are linked either by a deliberate strategy or more loosely linked by some unrealized ones and one that simply emerged.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;They start by saying that there is likely no purely deliberate and no purely emergent strategy. There would have needed to be precise intentions, articulated clearly, shared or accepted and realized exactly as intended without interference from outside forces&#8230; which is unlikely. As strategy is about being somewhat consistent in your actions, perfectly emergent strategy can&#8217;t exist because there would be consistency without any intentions &#8230; again unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Then they show several strategies that are common.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planned strategy
&quot;Organizations that must commit large quantities of resources to particular mission and so cannot tolerate unstable environments.&quot; You will often see that were lots of resources are at play, like at an airline for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entrepreneurial strategy
This revolves more around a central figure working in a co-operative environment. This one person has the vision and needs to articulate them well for them to be followed. As it is a personal vision, it is very easy to change, meaning that the company can change the vision and direction relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideological strategy
Here the vision is very well accepted and even shared. This goes as far as becoming an ideology which is shared by the members of the company. This is a lot harder to change, even by the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The umbrella strategy
In this case, there are simply boundaries which are set up and a general direction is defined. This umbrella might move if need be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process strategy
Here there are only processes set up which involve how the content of strategy is decided by the rest of the company. This often happens in unpredictable and uncontrollable environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unconnected strategy
This happens in companies of experts, complex settings, where sub unites have their own strategies and are only loosely connected to the mother company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consensus strategy
Here you start with a collective action rather than intention. You do things and slowly converge by adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imposed strategy
This time you set the strategy from outside, or rather it is being set, without the interference of anyone in the company. More often the environment only limits your movement though, and does not 100% direct it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Emergent strategy itself means that you take one step at a time and try to learn what works. This enables management &quot;to respond to an evolving reality rather than having to focus on a stable fantasy&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I should set up a jokes category ;)</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;An American tourist in Tel Aviv was about to enter the impressive Mann Auditorium to take in a concert by the Israel Philharmonic.</p>

<p>He was admiring the unique architecture, the sweeping lines of the entrance, and the modern décor throughout the building.</p>

<p>Finally he turned to his friend and asked if the building was named for Thomas Mann, the world famous author.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; his friend said, &quot;it&#8217;s named for Fredric Mann, from Philadelphia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? I never heard of him. What did he write?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A check.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;</p>

<p>Once again taken from the <a href="http://www.fool.com/">TMF</a> boards.</p>

<p>And another one following.</p>

<p>&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;I&gt;A 90 year old man was having his annual checkup and the doctor asked him how he was feeling.
&quot;I&#8217;ve never been better!&quot; he boasted. &quot;I&#8217;ve got an eighteen year old bride who&#8217;s pregnant and having my child! What do you think about that?&quot;
The doctor considered this for a moment, then said, &quot;Let me tell you a story. I knew a guy who was an avid hunter. He never missed a season. But one day went out in a bit of a hurry and he accidentally grabbed his umbrella instead of his gun.&quot;
The doctor continued, &quot;So he was in the woods and suddenly a grizzly bear appeared in front of him! He raised up his umbrella, pointed it at the bear and squeezed the handle. And do you know what happened?&quot; the doctor queried.
Dumbfounded, the old man replied &quot;No&quot;.
The doctor continued, &quot;The bear dropped dead in front of him!&quot;
&quot;That&#8217;s impossible!&quot; exclaimed the old man. &quot;Someone else must have shot that bear.&quot;
&quot;That&#8217;s kind of what I&#8217;m getting at&#8230;&quot; replied the doctor. &lt;/I&gt;</p>

I am half through and it is interesting. Sometimes I have to say that he seems to be a bit quick in his conclusions, but I simply think you might want to read this.</p>

<p>On a related not, this got me thinking too. It&#8217;s from somebody from the TMF boards I count as my friends: &lt;I&gt;I am not a right wing zealot but I do believe 110% that as the article states &quot;until they play by our rules, we must play by theirs&quot; in terms of how we fight this &quot;enemy&quot;.&lt;/I&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I already read this yesterday here in Germany and now this morning I found it on my Avango Channel of Business Week Online. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/mar2003/nf20030313_7075_db015.htm">Will &quot;French Kiss&quot; Be Next to Go?</a></p>

<p>The US is making themselves into laughing stock (or however the saying goes). Really. Come on! Snack bars and restaurants run by the House of Representatives, now no longer call french fries french fries but freedom fries. That&#8217;s abviously because the French are so evil in not letting the US have their way.</p>

<p>What Richard S. Dunham notices niceley is that &quot;&lt;I&gt;Hey gents, French fries aren&#8217;t even French. They originated in Belgium. It was the Americans that incorrectly attached the French to the fries in the first place.&lt;/I&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>And at the end of the story he notes: &lt;I&gt;Of course, it&#8217;s a lot easier to personally attack someone who disagrees with you rather than to reason together. That&#8217;s something politicians in both parties have been doing for years. Representative Jones said it well when he noted that the &quot;self-serving politics of passive aggression in this effort has discouraged me more than I can say.&quot; He was talking about the French. But congressman, you might want to take a good look in the mirror. &lt;/I&gt;</p>
